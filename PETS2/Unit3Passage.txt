  Today in Ontario there are more than 1600 livable structres that were built between 1816 and 1880 by people who came from another continent and settled in Canada.Most of these houses are of the same basi form :end-gabled,one-and-one-half story rectangular structures with the main entrance door centrally fixed on the long wall and a chimney at the short end of the house .Although certain details of the earliest houses differed ,depending on the date of construction or on where the builder came from,the main differences were caused by the nature of the building materials:log and stone.
